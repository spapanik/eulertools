# Installation

The easiest way is to use [pipx] to install `eulertools`.

``` console
$ pipx install eulertools
```

This is the only officially supported way of installing it.
As `eulertools` require python 3.11+, please make sure that
this is the version used by your system, or use a tool like
[pyenv] to create a shell with such a python version.
