Installation
============

The easiest way is to use `pipx`_ to install ``eulertools``.

.. code:: console

   $ pipx install eulertools

This is the only officially supported way of installing it.
As ``eulertools`` require python 3.11+, please make sure that
this is the version used by your system, or use a tool like
`pyenv`_ to create a shell with such a python version.
